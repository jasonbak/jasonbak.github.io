I’ve been wanting to write this for a while. Now that finals week is over, I finally have time that I haven’t had this entire semester to sit down and pour out my thoughts. I understand perhaps it would have more impact if it were done during finals week, while people are in a certain stressed mindset. However, all is well as I trust in His plan for me to share His nature to you all.
I’ve felt stress and discomfort on a level I’m still not comfortable sharing specifics with anyone. Saying this past semester—perhaps the past year—was hard is an understatement to how much internal struggle I can go through. The person I was in high school would not image who I am now, and I’m not sure how past me would think about that.
There’s constantly a part of me that wants to revert back to completely focusing on myself nad my endavaors that care for someone else. By caring for people, I don’t mean anything over the top. I just mean sometimes I want predonminantly school-based relatiosnhips in my life more than personal friendships in which the roots of your relationship don’t go back to love, it goes back to objective school. The feeling I get when I know I push myself academically surpasses most feeligns for me, and I looking back, I realize how much I benefited from surrounding myself with people whose number one priority was school. Some of you may not understand what I mean by number one because at least in my case, I wouldn’t be able to truly understand what that means until I saw it myself and lvied it.
So why do I live this life if it’s been causing me this identity criss for the past year and a half. It’s because I feel gratitude towards my Father who has shown me abundant love despite knowing all my flaws. As you can see, I’m a lot more selfish than most people. I get bitter and jealous when I see someone my age is succeeding on a level I’m not.
