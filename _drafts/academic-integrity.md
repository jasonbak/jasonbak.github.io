abstract: Carnegie Mellon is a big investment, so you should make the most out of it. As a representation of your educational institute, breaking academic integrity is harmful to yourself and the community you belong to.

In Fall '16, I took Modern Organic Chemistry, and I struggled immenseley with it. Not only was the
material not interesting, I also picked up material much slower than my fellow Chemistry majors. I spent
hours simply trying to understand my class notes, and I spent even more time working on homeworks and
studying for exams to get abyssmal scores. Throughout the final exam, there was a student who had been
looking at a cheat packet of reactions in her backpack. As she was not being super discreet about this
manner and she was sitting in the front row. I had two other friends in my class who saw her cheating as
well, so I had others to corroberate my claim that she was cheating. I was conflicted for the next few
days with what I should do. I discussed this problem with a few friends and even sent an email to a
professor in charge of a class I took the prior semester. I'll be a TA in Fall '17, so I thought it
would be good if I were to outline my thoughts on academic integrity before I take on the role.

Rule Utilitarnism says an action is right as it conforms to a rule that leads to the greatest good.


From my discussion with Roger and Jemmin as well as Dr. Kosbie

Hi, Dr. Kosbie:

This purpose of this email is for me to understand what would happen to a student if he/she gets reported of cheating on an exam.

I took your class last semester (my definitive favorite class at CMU, btw!), so this cheating incident has nothing to do with any of the classes you are involved in.

This semester witnessed another student cheating on a final exam, and I've felt conflicted with what to do since. From taking 15-112, I'm aware of how serious academic integrity is to you, so I would like to know specifically what you would do if a student reported another specific student of cheating on a final exam.

Thanks!

Best,
Jason Bak

Hi Jason.  Good to hear from you.  It's good that you are being reflective about this matter, as it presumably is serious.  I'd be happy to discuss this further with you, but here are my preliminary thoughts.

First, as an instructor:  I do take academic integrity seriously.  Students are paying $250,000 and investing four years of serious hard work into CMU, and why?  So that they can form a solid foundation for their career.  Then, they get a transcript from us which stands as proof for future employers of their academic accomplishments while here.  For this enterprise to work, that transcript must be accurate.  It simply must be truthful, that when we verify that a student has expertise at a certain level on a certain subject, that they in fact do.

I believe that cheating, especially major cheating (finals, term projects), is not at all just about the individual.  I see it plain as day as undermining the entire institution.  Every student loses, and loses big, if our transcripts lose their reputational value.  If companies cannot trust CMU when we verify our students' outcomes, then what?

Also, while of course some cheating does occur, even major cheating, let's be clear:  this is not high school (where cheating is clearly rampant), and most students at CMU do not cheat.  So we are talking about a small group of students who can ruin everything for everyone.  It's just not fair to everyone else.  And so we should not let them do it.

Of course, there is an ethical element as well, that cheating is ethically wrong, and so we should catch them cheating and hold them accountable simply for their own ethical development.  This is true, I believe, but the far weaker argument.  The far stronger argument has nothing to do with their personal ethics, and little to do with them at all, and everything to do with everyone else.  We owe it to the many non-cheaters that we not let the cheaters ruin this entire enterprise and destroy the tremendous value that all those years of hard work and dedication has created.

Now, how would I respond if a student were to inform me of cheating in 112?  I know the answer, since it has happened numerous times over the years.  First, I take it seriously.  But second, I do not take it as proof of cheating, but rather as evidence of the possibility of cheating.  So I investigate.  In the case of exams, I take the exam of the supposed cheater and compare it to the supposed provider(s), if there was one, and very carefully scrutinize the two (or more) exams, page by page, line by line, looking for evidence to corroborate the claim.  If found, I would continue the inquiry from there.  If not found, if I could not further corroborate the claim, I would not press charges.  However, I have in the past met with the possibly-cheating student and made it clear to them that there was some cloud over their work and discussed the issue of academic integrity with them, basically discussing what I said above with them.  That hopefully will reduce the likelihood of future cheating on their part.

Now, what if we do find corroborating evidence?  Well, then, cheating happened and we pursue it with vigor.  Cheating on a final exam is a serious offense, and all professors I know would take it very seriously, as would the Dean of Student Affairs.  We can't have it here, and we won't abide by it.

Finally, what should you do?  I think you should let the professor know.  The integrity of the course and of the university are at stake here, and your loyalty should be to the thousands of non-cheating peers you have here and not to this specific cheater you might otherwise be protecting.

If you were still unsure, you could send an anonymous note (email or handwritten), but that would further dilute its effectiveness.  But still, most faculty would look into such a claim, even if anonymous.  But if it was not anonymous, it would carry more weight, I think.

Anyhow, those are some of my thoughts.  I'd be happy to discuss it further with you.  Either way, it's good that you are giving it the thoughtful introspection it deserves.

Remember: we are nothing more than the integral of all the decisions we make in our lives.

Carpe diem.

David
