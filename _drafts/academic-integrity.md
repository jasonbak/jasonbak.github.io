From my discussion with Roger and Jemmin as well as Dr. Kosbie

(check email logs and messenger blogs in we love kelly to get transcript of discussion with kosbie)





I bought two Fuji X-T1 with Fujifilm 35mm f/2 for $800 each. I was goign to cancel one
of these orders, but then I considered if I should buy one for my one of my sisters.
There wasn't much reason to say no, and after thinking about htis for a while, I realzied
how weird this was. I am a very frugal person so the fact I am even considering, let aone
commiting to, buying this $800 camera set for one of my sisters is astonoishing. I then
realized I loo kat my money as my family's money. My parents instilled in me a way to look
at money as a shared resource between family members. The money my mom made was my dad's 
money and the family's money. Recently, I received a Fitbit and Audio Technica headphones
for free and isntead of selling them for a pretty penny, I instinctely asked my family 
in our grou[p chat if anyone wnated it. What's mine is theirs. I find it fascinating
my parents were able to develop this type of familial relatkionship so we are one unit
going through the world together. If I were considering giving this gift to a friend, I 
would be focused on the word "lose," but with my family, I focus on the word, "share" and 
"deserve." That's great.
