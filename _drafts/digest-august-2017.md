#### **Song:** 

Love this song! Jammed out to Jai Wolf live during Lollapalooza, and I've been 
listening to him daily since! His songs have an upliftding and mellow vibe to 
them. Jai Wolf also went to high school less than an hour away from me!

#### **Food:** Bud Namu

All-you-can-eat delicious Korean BBQ in Korea Town in LA for $15. Absolutely phenomenal!

#### **Productivity tool:**  Toggl

A manual time tracking web application. I log what I do throughout the day and tag 
the entries with useful identifiers. At the end of the week, I view my summary report
and reflect on how I can use my time more effectively to accomplish the goals I have.
When I start a Toggl timer, I am much less prone to do anything other than what the 
timer says I'm doing. It's a wonderful service, and I encourage you to give it a shot
for a bit. It took me a while to understand how I could customize it so it could 
become the vital productivity tool it is to me today, so feel free to play around with 
it and see how you can incorporate it into your work-flow!

#### **Hike:** Big C and Sutro Baths to Golden Gate Bridge via Land's End
