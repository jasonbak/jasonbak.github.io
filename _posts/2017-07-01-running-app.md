For the past year, I have thought about building a running app with some minor features I would like implemented, such as a button to give you directions back to your starting point when lost on a run and to track and insert planned running route. No ambition to monetize this because I see no way of creating a sensible business model and strategic plan to penetrate the running app market--just a fun project to learn iOS development.
