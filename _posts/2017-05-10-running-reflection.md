I started running in summer 2014, while I was transitioning to my senior year in high school. There was a cute girl from my school who biked around my neighborhood, so I started running around the block hoping to bump into her and begin our fairytale adventure together. Of course, I couldn’t just walk up to her and talk to her in school--impossible!

Since then, I ran my first half marathon in 2016 and my first marathon in 2017. I love when being able to fully commit myself to tasks knowing I am receiving a large benefit from the time I am devoting. Thus, knowing I am pushing myself continually throughout my run and seeing my work in the sweat falling off my face and feeling my heart banging in my chest is exciting to be apart of.

There comes a point when my body is yearning for a break to have a few moments away from the discomfort. I want to slow down and do anything less physically draining than running. However, I know I can take one more step. The only thing stopping me from doing so is myself telling me I can’t. Running is as mental as it is physical to me. The  to run as well as not to run is all in my mind, and it’s up to me to decide which one I want to pay attention to more. I can either succumb to my fatigue or capture the moment by running as hard as I can. Each step brings about a larger challenge and struggle, but these difficulties bring about a more fulfilling sense of accomplishment.

Running has given me a new way to understand my struggles and pursuits. My life is a marathon and some steps may be harder than others, but the only way to move forward is by putting one foot in front of the other.

Each journey starts with a single step and mine is no different.
