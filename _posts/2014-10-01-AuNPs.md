Metallic nanostructures such as gold, have exhibited promise as drug delivery systems and industrial scale catalysts. As differently shaped gold nanostructures exhibit unique properties, it is important to be able to efficiently control their shape formation. Conjugated gold nanostructures are desirable because they are recyclable catalysts. The purpose of this investigation was to control the shape and size of nanostructures synthsized on and via poly-(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA) or poly-(glycidyl methacrylate)@poly-(allylamine hydrochloride) (PGMA@PAH) colloidal spheres.
