## Overview

With [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), I developed seven page layouts: homepage, default, media-slideshow, note, notes-list, project, and projects-list. I set up the configuration files so that given a page with a certain set of variables, all data would be translated in HTML using the Liquid templating language. By passing in the right [YAML Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) variables into each of the pages and configuration file, Jekyll did most of the work for page creation and navigation. Given most variable content can be added and deleted using non-HTML files, the base HTML/CSS code will never have to be touched other than for the purpose of a redesign, which is useful for my [blog](/notes.html) and [project](/projects.html) posts.
